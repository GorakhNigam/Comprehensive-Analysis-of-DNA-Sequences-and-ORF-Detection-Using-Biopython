# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-DNA-Sequences-and-ORF-Detection-Using-Biopython
This project involved parsing DNA sequences from a FASTA file using Biopython, extracting gene identifiers, and identifying open reading frames (ORFs) across all three forward reading frames to determine the longest coding regions, while handling overlapping ORFs and reporting their positions, lengths, and frames.
